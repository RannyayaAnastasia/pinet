# pinet

Pinet is a (not yet) parallel interaction nets interpreter, inspired by Inpla. The language is Inpla's dialect.

## How to run

Install zig compiler v0.16, then it's simple:

```
$ zig build
$ zig build test
$ zig build run
```

Note that this will compile in debug mode. For release mode use `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast`.

## Current state

Pinet is in early development.

### Done

- custom rules
- single-threaded evaluation
- builtins (dups, erasers) using static virtual tables

### TODO

- args parsing
- golden tests using zig build system
- optional debug printing
- error handling on all stages
- number support
- rules for wildcart agents (`Agent() >< any => ...;`)
- lists support
- research into name chaining (a lot of unnecessary temporary names get created during execution, which leads to increased memory consumption)
- multithreading
