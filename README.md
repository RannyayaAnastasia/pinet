# pinet

Pinet is a (not yet) parallel interaction nets interpreter, inspired by Inpla. The language is Inpla's dialect.

## How to run

Install zig compiler v0.16, then it's simple:

```
$ zig build
$ zig build test
$ zig build run
```

Note that this will compile in debug mode. For release mode use `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast`.

## Current state

Pinet is in early development.

- [x] custom rules
- [x] single-threaded evaluation
- [x] builtins (dups, erasers) using static virtual tables
- [x] number support
- [x] lists support
- [ ] args parsing
- [ ] golden tests using zig build system
- [ ] optional debug printing
- [ ] error handling on all stages
- [ ] conditionals in rules
- [ ]rules for wildcart agents (`Agent() >< any => ...;`)
- [ ]research into name chaining (a lot of unnecessary temporary names get created during execution, which leads to increased memory consumption)
- [ ]multithreading
